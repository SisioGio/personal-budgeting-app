# Simulate a personal finance tool to manage expenses, incomes and budgets with forecast.
Define the appropriate data structure (as a JSON format sample) and provide sample data.
The code should:

- Allow to manage fiscal periods (202511,202512) and exact dates too.
- Allow to enter fixed/recurrent expenses with start and end date
- Allow to enter planned fixed expenses/incomes
- Allow to enter actuals (real income/expense)
- Compare actuals/budget (with possibility to change period of comparison
- Create forecasting in X months/years 
The tools must allow to see potential bank account growth and manage expenses, see available expenses for current month and available budget.
